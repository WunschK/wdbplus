Welcome to the wdbplus wiki!

To get started, please refer to the information in `project.md`.

Some basic concepts etc. are to be documented here. Until there is a more definite documentation included within the app itself, this is the place for doc to go. It may also serve as a stable target for documentation of older releases.

Your point of entry should be [[global-configuration]] which introduces you to the most important settings and caveats.

If you want to know more about the structure of collections within the app and what you can change, please have a look at [[Basic Collection Structure|basic-collection-structure]]. This page also contains information about settings to change when you want to use a different setup, e.g. place the app outside of `/db/apps`.

An overview of how projects can be customized and the app's configuration options, see [[project-specifics]] as well as [[wdbmeta.xml]] for project metadata.

Functions you can use are listed in [[the list of JavaScript functions|js-functions]] and [[the list of XQuery functions|xq-functions]].

To learn about what the most important files in this app do, consult [[the list of main HTML files|main-html-files]] and [[the list of other main files|main-files]].
